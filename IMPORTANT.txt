Configuration That I Use

* A-CLT :
	- eth0 (enp0s3) = 192.168.10.10 (static)

* A-RTR :
	- eth0 (enp0s3) = 192.168.10.1 (static)
	- eth1 (enp0s8) = - 172.16.10.1 (static)
			- 10.10.10.1 (VPN)
	- eth2 (enp0s9) = bridge adapter (DHCP)

* B-RTR :
	- eth0 (enp0s8) = - 172.16.10.2 (static)
			- 10.10.10.2 (VPN)
	- eth1 
	- eth2 (enp0s9) = bridge adapter (DHCP)

* B-SRV :
	- ethernet = same adapter like eth1 B-RTR


Task

* Basic Configuration
	For all machines in the given topology, do the following :
	- OS installed
	- Hostname configured
	- IP address set
	- Timezone set to Asia/Jakarta

* Client Addressing
	- Make sure clients in the internal network A (A-CLT) can automatically lease address from A-RTR (DHCP)
	- Make the leased address for A-CLT stay by mapping its hardware (Static)

* Intersite Connection
	- Configure OpenVPN for A-RTR and B-RTR to established site-to-site VPN.

* Directory Service
	- Set B-SRV as the Primary Domain Controller of beta.net forest
	- Create User0001-User1000

* DNS
	- A-CLT can access soup and drive dns but not the primary dns from B-SRV
	- DNS servers should be secured via IP whitelisting and cyrptography

* Web
	Configure two website :
	- https://drive.beta.net
		- Only User0500-User0699 can access this site.
		- should show the directory listing of C:\www\root\drive.beta.net in B-SRV
		- Proxied by B-RTR using HAProxy
	- https://soup.beta.net
		- Hosted in A-RTR using Nginx
		- Only Accessible from A-CLT
		- Webroot is located in /srv/www/soup.beta.net

* Storage
	- Share the path /srv/www/soup.beta.net using NFSv4
	- NFS share should only be accessible via A-CLT. Use a level 10 RAID as the underlying block storage

* File Sharing
	- Share the C:\share\collaboration directory in B-SRV via SMB. Allow only .html and .txt files whose size is no bigger than 5 MB
	- Limit access to User0300-User0499

* Backup
	- Configure a scheduler using SystemD in A-RTR to backup the content of soup.beta.net to B-RTR in C:\share\collaboration\soup.beta.net
	- The backup should happen every hour
